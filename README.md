## Description of dataset:
**Obtained**: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/youth-tobacco-survey-yts-data

**Dimensions**: 1,048,576R x 31C

**Description**: The Youth Tobacco Survey (YTS) dataset is derived from a national survey conducted by the Center for Disease Control (CDC). The survey collects data on tobacco use among youth in middle and high schools across the US from the years of 1999 to 2017, including the use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco. Survey questions cover topics such as tobacco use, attitudes toward smoking, exposure to tobacco advertising, and knowledge of the risks associated with tobacco products.
The goal is for the YTS data to help control strategies and initiatives aimed at reducing youth tobacco use. It helps researchers identify trends and high-risk populations to develop targeted interventions for tobacco use prevention among the American youth.
Specific types of data produced by the Youth Tobacco Survey (YTS) and their meaning.

* Prevalence of Tobacco Use:
  * Current Use:
    * Definition: Students who have used tobacco products (cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco) in the past 30 days.
    * Significance: Provides insight into the proportion of students currently using tobacco.
  * Ever Use:
    * Definition: Students who have ever tried or experimented with tobacco products, regardless of whether they are current users.
    * Significance: This data point helps understand initiation rates.
* Types of Tobacco Products:
   * Cigarettes: Data on cigarette smoking prevalence among youth, including daily and non-daily use.
   * E-cigarettes: Use of electronic nicotine systems (vaping) among students.
   * Cigars: Data on cigar smoking prevalence.
   * Smokeless Tobacco: Use of chewing tobacco among youth.
* Socio-Demographic Factors:
   * Age and Grade Level: Use patterns across different age groups and grade levels.
   * Gender: Variations in tobacco use between males and females.
* Perceptions and Attitudes:
   * Perceived Harm: Studentsâ€™ perceptions of the risks associated with tobacco use.
   * Access and Availability: Data on where students obtain tobacco products and their exposure to tobacco use.
* Trends Over Time:
   * Yearly Comparisons: Tracking changes in tobacco use prevalence and behaviors over multiple survey cycles.
   * Longitudinal Data: Following students over time to observe the changes in tobacco use from adolescence into young adulthood.
* Geographic Comparisons:
   * State-Level Data: Insights into variations in tobacco use, prevalence, policies, and interventions across different states.
   * Urban/Rural Difference: Contrasting tobacco use patterns between urban, suburban, and rural areas
* Correlates of Tobacco Use:
   * Protective Factors: Identifying factors that may reduce the likelihood of tobacco initiation or promote cessation among youth.
 
 By analyzing these data points, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of tobacco use among the American youth, identify risk and protective factors, and tailor interventions and policies to address the specific needs of different population groups.
