**Description:** The Youth Tobacco Survey (YTS) dataset is the result of a national survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The survey collects data on tobacco use among youth in middle and high schools across the US, including the use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco. Survey questions cover topics such as tobacco use, attitudes toward smoking, exposure to tobacco advertising, and knowledge of the risks associated with tobacco products.
The goal is for the YTS data to help control strategies and initiatives aimed at reducing youth tobacco use. It helps researchers identify trends and high-risk populations and develop targeted interventions to prevent tobacco use among American youth.
